This is a fork of dataphract/acid_io.  It contains changes necessary to build
and work properly in embedded no_std environments (those that are neither Unix
nor Windows and don't necessarily have a C library available either).  The
fork can be deleted if/when these changes are proven out and accepted by the
maintainers of acid_io, or if/when we decide we don't need io::{Read,Write} in
such environments or choose a different source for them.  Until then, this
fork is managed as described in RFD 211.
